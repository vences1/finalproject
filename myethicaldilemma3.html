<p>My ethical dilemma is i the nursing field to where they have to make many ethical desicions on patiants. 
This is an ehtical dilemma becasue when you get a patient that shows signs of being abused you have to make the choice on wether or not you are right and to report it. 
I chose this as my ethical dilemma because i want to be a oncology nurse or a er nurse. 
I wouldnt know how i was going to act in ths situation because i need to experience it to see how im am going to act.</p>
