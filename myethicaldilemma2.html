<p>Hey my name is Ruby Vences i am 17 years old. I like to watch tv , sleep, eat, and many
other things. I spend my days listening to music and dancing around the house with my 
family. I have 6 sisters 2 brothersand i have 3 nieces and 4 nephews. I love spending my 
time with them also and playing with them. My favorite genre of music is oldies i love 
oldies. I moved around a lot i've lived in Chatsworth in the Valley, Palmdale, Los Angeles
(my favorite place of all) now West Covina. I love movies like The Outsiders, Stand And
Deliver, Boulevard Nights, and last but not least Blood In Blood Out. Thats just somethings 
about me in a unordered way.  </p>
