<h1> What Is This Page About? </h1>
 
<p>This page is going to be me talking about what i've learned in my time of exploring computer science.
I have learned how to make a website using css, i have learned to add color and boxes and other attributes
to make a website look good and to catch the eye of the reader or webpage visitor. We learned how to make
our own code and any other things that were very interesting. At first the class may seem difficult
because you will not understand some things but you'll get the hang of it through some trials and errors
you'll learn many new things about computer science and how to build a website and many more things.
This page exists because this will be my final project for this class and i need the grade so humor me in
my lame but kinda nice website. </p>
